We favor early work and do not accept papers previously presented at the Western Finance Association meeting. All papers will be presented by a discussant, after which the authors will have an opportunity to respond. The meeting provides an excellent forum for authors to obtain detailed feedback from an accomplished and active group of finance scholars. BEST BUREAU PAPER AWARD The Financial Research Association will present the Best Bureau Paper Award, as selected by the conference attendees, regardless of research area. Authors of the winning paper will share a prize of $5,000. We will present a Best Discussant Award, which will be accompanied by a prize of $5,000. MICHAEL J. BARCLAY AWARD The Association will present the Michael J. Barclay Award to the young scholar who submits the best solo-authored paper. Young scholars include current PhD students and assistant professors who have held their PhD for less than three years. PH.D. STUDENT TRAVEL GRANTS The Association will provide up to three travel grants of $1,000 each for attending Ph.D. students. Submissions will be eligible if all authors are Ph.D. students. DUAL SUBMISSION OPTION Submitting authors may opt to participate in the Dual Submission Option with The Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) at no additional charge. To be eligible for this option, papers must not have been previously rejected from JFE, or under consideration at another journal at the time of conference submission. Dual-submitted papers will be reviewed for possible inclusion on the FRA conference program and for possible invitation to submit to the JFE. Authors will be informed of their dual submission status by early October. Invited authors may revise the paper before officially submitting through the JFE submission portal, but the manuscript must be submitted to JFE before January 15, 2026 to qualify under the dual submission. The JFE recognizes that the FRA focuses on early papers and young scholars, and that scientific work develops over time. If the invited dual submission is eventually rejected at JFE, the paper may be submitted to JFE at a future date through the normal submission process. If the dual-submitted paper is not invited through this process, it can still be submitted to the JFE under the normal submission process at a later date without prejudice. That is, the JFE will not flag papers that are not invited through the dual submission process and will have no institutional memory of these papers. SUBMISSIONS Papers may be submitted at https://fraconference.com/submit/. Students qualify for a reduced submission fee. There is no limit to the number of papers that one author may submit. Submitting authors will be notified of paper selection in October. After the program is set, a limited number of participants will be invited to register for the meeting.

This year, substantial cash prizes will be awarded to the top three teams ($5,000 for first, $3,000 for second, and $2,000 for third place). This year the BV Challenge will be held at the J.

Initial submissions will be due by the third week of October. Out of the starting field, six teams will be chosen by the week of October 20th to allow them time to arrange travel to Atlanta. A $1,000 travel stipend will be provided at the end of the BV Challenge to each out-of-area team that presents in Atlanta. With the support of its sponsors, the BV Challenge will provide teams with access for the competition to a private business valuation database provided by Business Valuation Resources, LLC (BVR), and other student resources from the American Society of Appraisers (now known as the ASA), in addition to the cash prizes. These resources represent a total value of over $5,000 per participant. BVR remains a leading provider of valuation data for privately held businesses. The BV Challenge sponsors and organizers will work to match each participating team with a local, professional, industry mentor to meet and advise student teams on professional appraisal best practices. In addition, all student participants will also receive a copy of “The Art of Valuation”, published by The Appraisal Foundation.

      "description": "A new issue of Finance Theory Insights, \"Surprising implications of regulations and technological advancement,\" is now available at https://www.financetheory.org/insights/issue-7-june-2025. It is published by the Finance Theory Group, the premier finance theory association. Finance Theory Insights highlights novel insights from a select set of recently published finance theory papers. Each column summarizes key results from a research paper, in non-technical terms, highlighting the novelty of the analysis and its implications to questions that regulators and practitioners care about. OVERVIEW: The current issue highlights surprising implications of regulations and technological advancement, which are at odds with what some would argue is common wisdom. “From Market Making to Matchmaking: Does Bank Regulation Harm Market Liquidity?” demonstrates that raising capital requirements for banks can, in the presence of competition from non bank liquidity providers, lead to lower average trading costs for customers. “Disclosing to Informed Traders” illustrates the downside of policymakers adopting one-size-fits-all disclosure rules. “Technological Progress and Rent Seeking” shows that while technological improvements make inputs more productive, they also make it easier for firms to appropriate the higher production of others. Finally, modern financial institutions have access to an array of sophisticated risk management tools that allow them to bundle risks in creative ways to enhance diversification, suggesting banks should have become more resilient over time. “Booms, busts, and common risk exposures” challenges this perceived wisdom by showing that superior risk management technologies can increase the overlap between banks’ portfolios and thereby make the system more rather than less fragile.",

The conference will be held in person in Cleveland, Ohio, and virtually. The global financial system continues to contend with major economic shifts and technological advancements worldwide. Risks and opportunities abound as the system navigates unprecedented internal vulnerabilities and external shocks. Conference Format The conference will bring together policymakers, market participants, and researchers in two types of sessions: •\tPolicy Discussions These sessions feature keynote addresses and panel discussions in which participants from industry, regulatory agencies, and academia share their insights. •\tResearch Forums These forums follow the format of an academic workshop and comprise sessions where researchers present and discuss submitted papers. Topics We welcome submissions of research on topics related to potential financial stability risks faced by financial markets and institutions, sources of financial system resilience, and related public policy. Conference topics include, but are not limited to, the following: Financial Institutions A rapidly changing economic environment poses challenges for financial institutions and their supervisors. Risk management tools and strategies will be tested by fluctuations in inflation, output, and changing regulatory conditions. A rapidly evolving fintech and digital asset sector, along with the associated network effects, can lead to further risks at a systemic level. How will institutions adapt as these risks and regulations change at an unprecedented pace? How can regulators and policymakers prepare? Are existing microprudential and macroprudential toolkits sufficient? We welcome submissions on the following topics and others relating to financial institutions and financial stability: •\tBank lending to nonbank financial institutions (NBFI) •\tInsurance markets •\tBanking as a service (BaaS) •\tInterest rate risk •\tRisks of rapid growth •\tThe changing regulatory environment •\tBanking in an uncertain monetary policy landscape •\tGeopolitical risk Financial Markets Inflation, high levels of debt, geopolitical shifts, and central bank policy around the world have added stress to financial markets not seen in the recent past. Volatility spikes, fire sales, and financial contagion happen at an increasing pace. The continued development of algorithms, decentralized finance (DeFi), and complex artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to add novel risks and blur the distinctions between markets and institutions. Do investors recognize these risks? How quickly can investors adapt to the changing circumstances? How does the opacity resulting from deficiencies in reporting, risk management, and operational standards for these risks affect investor behavior? We welcome submissions on the following topics and others relating to financial markets and financial stability: •\tRisks associated with high levels of public debt and with central bank balance sheet policies •\tShort-term funding •\tCentral clearing of government bonds •\tRegulation of digital assets •\tThe future of the U.S. dollar in financial markets •\tFinancial markets in a fragmented world •\tReal estate outlook •\tThe future of monetary policy Technology and the Financial System New technologies are developing at an accelerating pace and are influencing the way that financial institutions and markets are managed and supervised. What will be the impact of artificial intelligence on the financial system? What are the risks and opportunities from a new environment for digital assets? How can firms adapt to the growing threat of cyber risk? How can policymakers understand and benefit from these new technologies? We welcome submissions on the following topics and others relating to technology and financial stability: •\tThe impact of generative AI and deep learning models •\tThe rise of fintech •\tDigital assets •\tCyber attacks •\tFaster settlement for payments and securities •\tSupervision and policymaking in the new technological age Scientific Program Reviewers •\tWill Cong, Cornell SC Johnson College of Business •\tVictoria Ivashina, Harvard Business School •\tChotibhak Jotikasthira, Southern Methodist University, Cox School of Business •\tAnton Korinek, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business •\tNagpurnanand Prabhala, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School •\tGregory Nini, Drexel University, LeBow College of Business •\tGregory F.

      "description": "Entrepreneurial activity—particularly that supported by alternative investors—tends to concentrate in large urban centers due to factors such as founder co-location, access to skilled labor, and the proximity of venture capital. Yet today’s urban entrepreneurial ecosystems face a new generation of challenges, as they grapple with balancing the often-competing interests of startups, investors, and local communities under conditions of growing uncertainty. These ecosystems must increasingly navigate complex trade-offs between rapid growth vs. inclusive development, freedom of innovation vs. regulation, and private ambitions vs. public responsibilities. This workshop examines the sustainability of urban entrepreneurial ecosystems through an interdisciplinary lens, convening researchers, policymakers, and practitioners from the startup and venture capital sectors. The event will be held at Bocconi University on November 21, 2025. We are seeking high-quality submissions employing diverse theoretical perspectives and methods to deal with these topics: 1. Micro-geography of entrepreneurship 2. Relationship between urban contexts and entrepreneurship 3. Entrepreneurial finance and local impacts 4. Social inequality and entrepreneurship 5. Local public policies and entrepreneurship 6. Sustainability of startup ecosystems The workshop will include keynote addresses by Scott Stern (MIT) and Mario Small (Columbia University), as well as an industry panel featuring policymakers, investors, and institutional stakeholders. The submission deadline is July 31, 2025. You can submit a full paper or an extended abstract (max 5 pages) via email at: lara.airaghi@unibocconi.it. The organizers will cover accommodation expenses.

      "description": "09 Oct 2025 - 10 Oct 2025 MIT GGCFP 12th Annual Conference | October 9-10, 2025 • Cambridge, MA \"Reassessing Government Assets and Liabilities: Putting the Finance into Public Finance\" CALL FOR PAPERS: MIT’s Golub Center for Finance and Policy (GCFP) is inviting paper submissions for its 12th annual conference, which this year is on the theme of government asset and liability measurement and how it can be improved. Globally, growing government debt burdens and structural imbalances have raised concerns about fiscal sustainability. Yet projections based on official statistics reveal only part of the picture. A reexamination of government assets and liabilities through the lens of financial economics can shed new light on the about the size and risk of fiscal imbalances, implications for interest rates and financial markets, and policy options for effective mitigation. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: evaluations of contingent financial, environmental and other liabilities; sovereign wealth funds; state-owned enterprises; public sector pension systems; mark-to-market and fair value accounting applications to government assets and liabilities; valuation and fiscal implications of opaque public assets (e.g., biodiversity and other environmental resources, research and other infrastructure); fiscal effects of monetary policy; government accounting and budgetary rule reform; the economics of privatization; international applications and comparisons. Both empirical and theoretical papers are welcome, including preliminary drafts. The format is a short presentation, followed by comments from discussants and open conversation among participants and the audience. The conference will be in-person in Cambridge, MA and online. Program Committee Chairs: Deborah Lucas, MIT; Peter Fisher, MIT GCFP PAPER SUBMISSIONS: Please email a PDF version of your paper to deirdre@mit.edu with the subject “GCFP 12th Submission” Deadline for submitting a draft is July 10, 2025. Selected authors will be informed by July 31. Each year the MIT GCFP’s annual conference brings together leading academics, policy makers and practitioners to discuss research and new developments in a selected area related to one or more of the main research tracks of the Center: •\tEvaluation and Management of Government Financial Institutions •\tRegulation of Financial Markets and Institutions •\tRisk Measurement and Management in the Public Sector The mission of the MIT GCFP is to serve as a catalyst for innovative, cross-disciplinary and non partisan research and educational initiatives that address the unique challenges facing governments in their role as financial institutions and as regulators of the financial system.

      "description": "ABOUT THE AI AND REAL ESTATE DAY Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are rapidly transforming the real estate finance and economics landscape. AI algorithms can analyze complex datasets from market trends and property specifics to buyer behaviors and economic indicators. Such tools offer significant benefits, including enhanced data-driven decision-making, more accurate predictive analytics, and improved operational efficiency in real estate. As AI-driven insights reshape how properties are valued, developed, and traded, understanding their impact has become a crucial frontier for research in real estate. In light of these advances, the 2nd AI in Finance Conference will feature a dedicated AI and Real Estate program on its third day (see SSRN: https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/janda/announcement/?id=17194). This special program aims to bring together leading academics and practitioners to explore cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and real estate markets. We especially encourage work that bridges methodological innovations in AI/ML with applications in real estate finance and urban economics. The AI and Real Estate program will feature a keynote address by Professor Thies Lindenthal (University of Cambridge) and presentations of selected papers, followed by an industry-academic panel, fostering dialogue on how advanced analytics (e.g. deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, geospatial data) are generating new insights in property valuation, investment strategy, sustainability, urban planning, and beyond. CALL FOR PAPERS We invite submissions of full papers or extended abstracts presenting theoretical or empirical research at the frontiers of AI and real estate, including but not limited to: •\tAI-driven property valuation and appraisal models •\tMachine learning for real estate market forecasting and trend analysis •\tAI applications in real estate development and land use planning •\tAI in real estate investment and portfolio management •\tAI for sustainable real estate and climate risk assessment •\tUrban analytics and smart-city applications in real estate •\tNatural language processing and large language models for real estate market analysis •\tComputer vision and geospatial analysis for property and neighborhood insights •\tAI-driven demand for real estate: Data centers and infrastructure •\tEthics, fairness, and regulatory challenges in AI-driven real estate KEYNOTE SPEAKER Professor Thies Lindenthal (University of Cambridge) TRAVEL The preferred airline partner for the event is Air Canada, offering a discount of up to 10% on eligible fares to Montréal (YUL).

      "description": "The Atlanta Fed's signature annual policy and research event, Financial Markets Conference, kicks off May 19 at 8:30 a.m. (ET) with a keynote by Federal Reserve vice chair Philip N. Jefferson, followed by sessions about the rise of nonbanks in credit markets, the evolving market for bank funding, central banks’ operational framework, monetary policy, and more by leading academics, policymakers, and financial markets practitioners. Join us online for two days of thought-provoking discussions! Everything you need is right here: Take a look at our agenda for a full list of this year's sessions, speakers, and their biographies, and tune into the livestream of each session on Youtube, see: https://www.atlantafed.org/news/conferences-and-events/conferences/2025/05/18/financial-markets-conference?utm_medium=paid-media&utm_source=google-ads&utm_campaign=financial-markets-conference Monday, May 19 8:30\tWelcome Raphael Bostic, President and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 8:45\tKeynote Philip N. Jefferson, Vice Chair, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Moderator: Raphael Bostic, President and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 9:45\tResearch Spotlight 1: \"Bank Capital and the Growth of Private Credit\" Presenter: David Scharfstein, Professor of Finance and Banking, Harvard University Moderator: W. Scott Frame, Senior Vice President and Deputy Head of Research, Bank Policy Institute 10:50 Policy Session 1: The rise of nonbanks in credit markets Nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) are becoming increasingly active participants in credit markets, operating in parallel or competing with traditional lenders. Furthermore, bank loans in part support NBFI asset growth, linking regulated intermediaries to unregulated ones. This session will discuss how much of a systemic risk NBFIs pose to financial markets and their connections to the regulated banking sector. Given the risks and vulnerabilities associated with NBFIs as alternatives to bank credit, are banks and nonbanks complements or substitutes in the provision of credit? How much credit risk has migrated to NBFIs, and have banks' exposures to credit and funding risks declined as a result? The session will also discuss how policymakers might envision a regulatory framework for NBFIs and the role nonbanks could play for the implementation and transmission of monetary policy. Moderator: Andreas Lehnert, Director, Financial Stability, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Panelist: Ana Arsov, Chief Investment Officer, Bright Fame Holdings Panelist: Nicola Cetorelli, Head of Financial Intermediation, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Panelist: Elisabeth de Fontenay, Karl W. Leo Distinguished Professor of Law, Duke University Panelist: Liz Oakes, External Member, Financial Policy Committee, Bank of England 1:15 Policy Session 2: The increasing role of nonbank institutions in the Treasury and money markets Although the structure of the Treasury market, which is dominated by nonbank financial institutions, is efficient in normal times, periods of market stress can challenge its resilience. This session will assess the scope of nonbanks' footprint in the Treasury and money markets, and it will examine their increasing role for the smooth intermediation and functioning of these markets. The session will also discuss the sources of demand by money market funds, stable-coin funds, and relative-value hedge funds for short- and long-dated Treasuries. What are the implications—and potential risks—for financial stability and monetary policy transmission? The panel will also evaluate recent proposals to extend, via centrally cleared trades, the standing repo facility to a wider set of nonbank market participants as well as encouraging more direct all-to-all trading in repo and Treasury markets. Moderator: Lorie K. Logan, President and Chief Executive Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Panelist: Lou Crandall, Chief Economist, Wrightson ICAP Panelist: Deirdre K. Dunn, Head of Global Rates, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

Additionally, the trend toward faster payments combined with the substantial influence of social media has created the potential for banks to experience large, unexpected fund outflows. This session will consider pertinent questions around this topic. Is a shifting environment causing banks to lose access to low-cost, stable funding, or have banks successfully adapted to these changes? To the extent that banks are losing access, what are the implications for banks' asset portfolios? How should central banks and bank supervisors respond to the change? Furthermore, how should regulatory authorities respond to any implied change in the roles of banks and nonbanks? Moderator: Nellie Liang, Senior Fellow, Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, Brookings Institution Panelist: Stasie Kostova, Executive Vice President and Treasurer, Comerica Panelist: Margaret E. Tahyar, Partner and Head of Financial Institutions Practice, Davis Polk Panelist: Lawrence J. White, Robert Kavesh Professor of Economics, Stern School of Business, New York University 10:50 Research Spotlight 2: \"Asset Purchase Rules: How QE Transformed the Bond Market\" Presenter: Tyler Muir, Associate Professor of Finance, UCLA Anderson School of Management Moderator: Troy Davig, Chief US Economist, Symmetry Investments 1:00 p.m.\tPolicy Session 4: Central banks’ operational framework—putting monetary policy into practice Several central banks have revised their operational framework for implementing monetary policy. These revisions have resulted in three different approaches to managing the policy interest rate: a demand-driven approach, a supply-driven approach, and a hybrid of both. In this session, the impact that these different liquidity approaches have on the transmission of monetary policy, bank and nonbank overnight lending, and financial stability will be discussed. Operational frameworks' effects on balance sheet normalization will also be discussed. Moderator: David Beckworth, Senior Research Fellow, The Mercatus Center at George Mason University Panelist: Claudio Borio, Former Head of the Monetary and Economic Department, Bank for International Settlements Panelist: Imène Rahmouni-Rousseau, Director General Market Operations, European Central Bank Panelist: Patricia Zobel, Head of Macroeconomic Research and Market Strategy, Guggenheim Partners 7:00\tKeynote and Dinner Mary C.

      "description": "ADVANCE YOUR RESEARCH THROUGH PRACTICE The PhD and Postdoc Workshop on October 27, 2025, held as part of the AI in Finance Conference, is designed for early-career researchers interested in empirical finance, machine learning, data-driven research, and programming in Matlab. This one-day workshop offers hands-on experience with WRDS data, replication of top-tier finance papers applying machine learning techniques, and interactive feedback from senior faculty. Whether you are planning your dissertation, developing an empirical paper, or aiming to deepen your technical toolkit, this workshop delivers essential skills to succeed in modern research in financial economics. WORKSHOP HIGHLIGHTS -\tWRDS Data Overview: Gain a comprehensive understanding of key datasets (CRSP, Compustat, IBES) and how they are used in academic finance research. -\tRetrieving WRDS Data via SQL & Matlab: Learn how to access and manipulate financial data from WRDS using SQL queries embedded in Matlab scripts. Participants will retrieve real-world data and apply it in a replicable research workflow. -\tAI & Machine Learning Essentials: Build conceptual understanding of how AI methods translate into empirical finance. Drawing on frameworks established in recent work such as Gu et al. (2020), we demonstrate how machine learning methods—like elastic net and random forest—can be effectively applied to forecast stock returns and evaluate economic relevance beyond traditional regression models. -\tPaper Replication in Empirical Asset Pricing: Learn to replicate influential papers in empirical asset pricing—ranging from foundational tests (e.g., Black et al., 1972; Fama and MacBeth, 1973) to cutting-edge machine learning applications in predictability and asset pricing research (e.g., Gu et al., 2020; Avramov et al., 2023). All codes, materials, and slides will be made available to participants afterwards. WHO SHOULD APPLY -\tPhD students and early-career researchers in finance, economics, or data science -\tStrong interest in empirical work and data -\tBasic asset pricing knowledge such as the CAPM and the Fama and French (1993) model -\tBasic knowledge in programming with Matlab -\tNo prior experience with or access to WRDS required. Access to WRDS is provided by Concordia University. APPLICATION PROCEDURE To apply for the PhD and Postdoc Workshop at the AI in Finance 2025 Conference, please submit your CV including following information: -\tA list of published papers and working papers (if available) -\tA brief description of your knowledge in empirical asset pricing -\tA brief summary of your programming skills Send all materials to AIfinance@concordia.ca with the subject line 'AI in Finance Conference: PhD and Postdoc Workshop' by September 15, 2025.

      "location": "Philadelphia, PA",
      "description": "10 Oct 2025 - 11 Oct 2025 2025 Wharton Conference on Liquidity and Financial Fragility Call for Papers Liquidity and financial fragility have been central to academic research and policy debates. In recent decades, episodes of acute market stress, such as the global financial crises, the pandemic, and regional banking turmoil, have highlighted the complex interplay between liquidity provision, financial stability, and broader macroeconomic outcomes. Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of new technologies is reshaping markets and introducing new risks. Although government policies and interventions may help contain systemic risks, they also bring uncertainty and intensify tensions between price and financial stability. As global financial conditions in 2025 continue to reflect elevated uncertainty and geopolitical strain, the need to understand the drivers and consequences of financial fragility and its global macroeconomic implications remains as vital as ever. With this goal in mind, we are pleased to announce the 2025 Wharton Conference on Liquidity and Financial Fragility, building on the success of the past ten editions. The eleventh edition will be held at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), beginning on the morning of Friday, October 10, 2025, and concluding in the afternoon of Saturday, October 11, 2025. A conference dinner will take place on Friday evening, featuring a keynote address by Antoinette Schoar, Executive Editor of the Journal of Finance and the Stewart C. Myers-Horn Family Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Further details on past editions of the conference are available on the conference website: https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wharton-liquidity-conference/ We invite submissions of empirical and theoretical papers in various fields of economics and finance that relate to the broad theme of Liquidity and Financial Fragility. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: •\tCoordination failures, self-fulfilling beliefs, and runs •\tFragility in banks and non-bank institutions •\tLiquidity and frictions in financial markets and macroeconomy •\tSystemic risk and financial regulation •\tMonetary policy and financial stability •\tDysfunctions, frictions, and fragility in U.S. Treasury markets •\tCurrency dominance, sovereign debt crises, and their link to the financial sector •\tGeopolitical tensions, trade conflicts, and financial fragility •\tInflation, interest rate risks, and implications on financial fragility •\tThe real impact of crises and fragility on firms’ financing and investment policies •\tFinTech, artificial intelligence (AI), and their implications for financial stability •\tNew payment technologies, digital currencies, and their implications for the monetary system The organizers of the conference are Vincent Glode, Itay Goldstein, and Yao Zeng (all from Wharton Finance), and Guillermo Ordonez (from Penn Economics). Please submit your paper online at https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wharton-liquidity-conference/2025-conference/cfp. The submission deadline is July 1, 2025.

      "description": "30 Oct 2025 - 02 Nov 2025 Conference Sponsored by Birmingham Institute for Sustainability and Climate Action (BISCA) Sustainable Financial Innovation Centre (SFiC) American University of Sharjah (AUS) UAE-UK Business Council Sustainable finance has made remarkable strides over the past decade, with fund managers and corporations increasingly under pressure from stakeholders and shareholder activism to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into their portfolios and asset allocation strategies. This shift has been driven by growing awareness of climate risks and the demand for responsible investing. Developments in green and sustainability-linked bonds, and ESG-focused investment portfolios highlight the growing importance of aligning financial practices with sustainable goals. These innovative financial instruments help bridge the gap between environmental and financial sectors, contributing to the global effort to address climate change and other pressing environmental challenges. Moreover, regulatory frameworks and policy initiatives such as the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) have been instrumental in pushing forward the sustainable finance agenda (European Commission, 2024). However, recent geopolitical tensions have begun to slow this momentum. A particularly significant setback occurred with President Trump’s second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which undermined global climate commitments and introduced uncertainty about the future direction of climate policy. This withdrawal, along with other geopolitical factors, has led some companies to hesitate in fully pursuing their ESG agendas, fearing that the lack of cohesive international policy could create financial and operational risks. Despite these challenges, there are rising calls to harness rapid technological advancements—particularly in artificial intelligence (AI)—to drive more innovative solutions to the climate crisis. AI offers tremendous potential for improving the accuracy of climate risk assessments, optimizing energy consumption, and developing sustainable infrastructure, which could help mitigate the impact of climate change. By leveraging these technological innovations, the financial sector could help accelerate progress toward sustainability, even in the face of uncertain political climates. Looking ahead, sustainable finance is expected to continue evolving as both market demand and regulatory pressures increase as global environmental challenges become more urgent, however, the dynamics of sustainable finance in directing capital flows towards environmentally and socially responsible projects will be different to cope with the recent development on geopolitical uncertainty. Therefore, this conference will highlight the latest developments in sustainable finance during these volatile times, focusing on how innovation, particularly through emerging technologies, can help address climate challenges and drive the global economy towards a more sustainable future fostering a resilient and sustainable global economy for future generations (Eccles et al., 2021). This three-day conference will feature an evening reception, Gala dinner and Conference paper presentations. Paper submission procedure: We invite you to submit your paper to the Sustainable Financial Innovation Centre (SFiC) conference by sending it directly to our email: h.farag@bham.ac.uk Please use the subject heading Paper Submission: Developments in Sustainable Finance: A New Era of Financial Innovation.” In your submissions, please indicate whether you want your paper to be considered for The International Journal of Finance & Economics.

      "location": "Boston, Massachusetts",
      "description": "16 Oct 2025 - 17 Oct 2025 The conference will be held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on October 16 and 17, 2025 Paper Submission Deadline: Sunday, June 15, 2025 The Federal Reserve invites researchers to submit academic research papers to be considered for presentation at a conference on the topic of stress testing. The conference will provide a forum for researchers in academic and policy institutions to discuss important topics, methods, and challenges related to stress testing for financial institutions and the financial system. Background Since the Great Financial Crisis, stress testing has become a key tool for evaluating the resilience of financial institutions and the financial system. For example, supervisory stress tests of large US banks are now conducted annually by the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar stress testing efforts have also been adopted internationally in recent years. Stress testing has become increasingly important in assessing the resilience of the financial system. It has also become a more prominent risk management tool for financial institutions. Accordingly, stress testing as a discipline has become an increasingly important area for economic research and policy. This conference is part of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to highlight research into stress testing. For more information, please visit the website below, which also has links to prior conference agendas including 2024: https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/events/federal-reserve-stress-testing-research-conference/2025.aspx. Conference Format The conference will be held in person, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The conference will consist of presentations of academic research papers. Some of the paper presentations will be followed by discussions. With the authors’ approval, the papers presented at the conference may be made available to the public on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Paper Submission Topics The conference will consider high quality research papers broadly related to stress testing. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: • The economic and macroprudential effects of stress tests and bank regulation • Balancing the costs and benefits of bank regulation • The roles and risks of nonbank financial intermediaries and their interplay with the banking system • Financial instruments for risk transfer and their implications • Modeling bank revenues, credit, and counterparty risks • Interest-rate, liquidity, and inflation risk in the banking system • Design of macroeconomic and financial market scenarios • Regulatory and supervisory approaches to non-financial risks, such as cybersecurity and operational risk, and emerging technologies, such as AI Paper Submissions We invite authors to submit papers or extended abstracts to StressTestingConference@frb.gov by Sunday, June 15, 2025. Complete papers are strongly encouraged. Extended abstracts should include a description of the motivation for the research question, the method and data used to study the question, and key results. Submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee, and authors whose papers have been accepted to the conference will be notified around the end of July. We expect to have limited funding to help cover travel expenses for paper presenters and discussants affiliated with academic institutions.

A particular preference will be given to papers that study primary market frictions that lead to higher financing costs/shortage of capital for state and local governments, secondary market frictions that increase transactions costs for investors, the role of retail investors or government policies that target these investors for bond price formation, as well as the effect of state and federal policies on state and local government access to external finance. All submissions, both empirical and theoretical, in these areas are welcome. The keynote speaker for the conference will be David Wessel, the director of the Hutchins Center for Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. The deadline for submitting papers (or extended abstracts) is May 31, 2025. Submissions should be sent by e-mail to chi.muni.finance@chi.frb.org. Municipal market experts or academics interested in serving as discussants at the meeting or who have questions about the conference should contact Ivan Ivanov (email: ivan.ivanov@chi.frb.org). Authors of accepted papers will be notified in June.

      "description": "25 Aug 2025 - 27 Aug 2025 FINAL CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS AND UPDATE Future Finance Fest (3f) 3f seeks to foster deep conversations and collaborations between finance academics and fintechs. Any work with practical implications for the future of finance is welcome. Submissions are accepted through two tracks: the academic track and the fintech/practitioner track. Individual conference sessions, however, will deliberately include presentations from both academics and fintechs. This means that presentations will need to minimize jargon in order to be accessible and engaging to both sides. In addition to presentation sessions, there will be keynotes and panel discussions. The closing keynote will be delivered by Professor Albert J. Menkveld (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute). Confirmed panelists include Dr. Christel Rendu de Lint, co-CEO of Vontobel Asset Management, and Mr. Lukas Savickas, Minister of the Economy and Innovation of the Republic of Lithuania. 3f will take place in Old Town Vilnius (a UNESCO World Heritage site), in collaboration with key players in the Lithuanian fintech ecosystem. For more information about 3f, visit https://fufifest.org. 3f is aiming to make an impact not only on the future of finance, but also on the future of finance conferences. To this end, we will be experimenting with multiple innovations. All presenters will have the option of being professionally filmed and receiving recordings of their presentations, at no cost. The audience will have the opportunity to type in live commentary/questions during a presentation that will be shown on a separate screen (but only if the presenter agrees to this). All authors of submissions accepted through the academic track can request AI-generated podcasts about their papers, at no cost. 3f is sponsored by Ed.movie Inc., which produced the Finance+Humor program at the 50th European Finance Association meeting, and panel discussions will partially inherit its light-hearted spirit (see e.g. the “Finance Meets Comedy” talk show recorded at the EFA, https://youtu.be/RbqAmBgs55w). SUBMISSION AND REGISTRATION: The submission deadline is Monday, 14 April. Those submitting through the academic track can submit full papers (including early-stage work), extended abstracts or case studies. Those submitting through the practitioner/fintech track can submit papers, extended abstracts, case studies, slide decks and proposals for panel discussions. All those submitting to 3f should add a note explaining why their work is relevant to both academics and practitioners/fintechs. Decisions will be communicated by Monday, 26 May. There is no submission fee. To register and/or to submit your work, visit https://www.conftool.net/fufifest2025/. The registration fee includes access to all of the event activities, meals and snacks. CONTACT: We are open to all suggestions aimed at increasing the impact of the event and participants’ enjoyment of it. If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to contact the the organizers at info@fufifest.org",

      "location": "nan",
      "description": "ANR-funded \"Equipement d'excellence since 2021, Pladifes aims to make innovative data available to academic research in the service of sustainable finance research. The program, hosted by the Institut Louis Bachelier, proposes to provide free access to its COGEM database, as well as personalized support in data use, for up to 5 selected research projects. COGEM is currently the largest available database of emissions from listed companies, estimated by Machine Learning using an open-source methodology. Data is available from 2005 to 2024, on scopes 1, 2 and 3. This database is already and will remain available to non-selected academics, at a cost of €1,200 + management fees per user. This call is open to the entire academic community, with no restrictions in terms of academic disciplines or methodological approaches. Selected projects may address the following use cases, although this is not an exhaustive list (see below). • Study of the effect of national policies on emissions and carbon intensities at company level. • Study of transition risk and/or reputational risk. • Study of trends and reductions in carbon emissions. • Calculation of financed emissions and carbon footprint of insurers. • Conduct stress tests. • Assessment of companies' alignment with climate scenarios. • Study of the links between companies' financial and environmental performance. • Assessing the credibility of emissions targets published by companies. Projects must involve at least one researcher affiliated to an academic institution. Projects involving several teams, and in particular those with a real European dimension, will be studied with particular interest. Priority will be given to innovative projects exploring themes or mobilizing approaches that have been little explored. Similarly, for projects of equal quality and interest, the jury will give priority to applications in which the support provided by Pladifes data is decisive and differentiating for the project's success. Applicants are therefore invited to highlight in their application the added value they expect from COGEM data for their research. • Selected projects will be subject to the following requirements: Any publication involving the use of data obtained via this call for projects must obligatorily quote the following (in French or English version below): “Research work carried out thanks to the Pladifes COGEM project as part of the EquipEx Pladifes (ANR-21-ESRE-0036), hosted at the Institut Louis Bachelier”. • At the end of a maximum period of one year after being selected, prize-winners will be expected to submit a scientific working paper summarizing the work in which the data were used, including any unfinished work. The Institut Louis Bachelier also undertakes not to divulge or use this information, except with the explicit agreement of the prize-winners. • Winners will be invited to present their work at a dedicated event, around September 2026. Barring exceptional constraints, participation, either on-site or remotely, will be compulsory. Further details of the event will be communicated closer to the time HOW TO APPLY: Submissions can be made no later than May 16, 2025 via our submission form. Submissions should be between 2 and 5 pages long (excluding bibliography) and structured as follows: • Interest of the subject and context • Project description and methodology • Expected contribution • Presentation of the research team • Timetable Submission form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeN7mcfxutYorOkbnWbleDNqUl4U2fQQff3QR75GMjUBMj_dg/viewform?usp=header MORE INFORMATION: Pladifes website: https://pladifes.institutlouisbachelier.org/ COGEM webpage: https://pladifes.institutlouisbachelier.org/ghg-emissions/ Contact : Thibaud BARREAU, thibaud.barreau@institutlouisbachelier.org",

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE CITY •\tBusan is Korea's second largest city and the largest trading port. This harbor city sits adjacent to the Korean Straits and Japan and is a major hub for trade and tourism. Busan has hosted international events such as the 2002 14th Asian Games and the annual Busan International Film Festival (BIFF). •\tSight-seeing in Busan (or Pusan) can typically be classified into two groups: seashore and interior land sight-seeing. Seashore sightseeing includes such sights as the beach areas, islands, and many seashore parks. Busan's most charming tourist point is its beautiful sea vistas. The southeastern beach areas have amazing views of the fantastically shaped rocks and islands, which are a must see. The famous beaches of Haeundae, Gwangalli, and Songjeong are enjoyed by many. Boating, jet skis, and banana boats are just among a few of the water recreation activities visitors can take advantage of. Amnam Park and Iigidae costal park offer views of nature's masterpieces. The natural beauties of Busan can also be taken in by riding the cruise boats departing from the harbor.

      "title": "5th CEPR-Stigler Center Conference on Political Economy of Finance: Governance in a Polarized World",
      "conference_dates": "24 Oct 2025",
      "location": "London",
      "description": "In a time of large shocks and rising inequality, the political divide is growing. Polarization forces changes to private and public governance, reshaping financial markets, corporate strategies and public policy. How does corporate governance adjust in a more conflictual world? How do a divided society and politicized corporations respond to major societal challenges such as climate change or economic decline? How do inequality and politicization shape governance choices and the trade-offs faced by voters, businesses and governments? How can organizations foster trust and cohesion in an era of polarization? The conference invites theoretical and empirical papers on these and related themes. The conference will be held in-person at Imperial College London. The conference is scheduled on Friday 24 October 2025 and followed by a dinner with all participants. The keynote will be delivered by Nobel Laureate: prof. Jean Tirole (Toulouse School of Economics). Submission procedure: Please submit papers by logging in to https://hub.cepr.org/ and then going to https://hub.cepr.org/event/4675 to find the conference submission page. The submission deadline is Sunday 22 June 2025 (6PM BST). If you have any difficulties submitting your paper for this event, please contact Jemila Benchikh at jbenchikh@cepr.org for assistance (with subject header “Stigler Center-CEPR Political Economy of Finance Conference”).

      "description": "Challenges in Low- and Middle-Income Countries – From Climate Change to Geopolitics Special Issue in Finance Research Letters The World Bank distinguishes between low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income countries. The economies of low- and middle-income (LMI) countries—historically referred to as developing countries—stand at the crossroads of unprecedented challenges and opportunities. With large parts of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean represented in this group of LMI countries, these nations are home to diverse economies and rich natural resources. However, these countries collectively face systemic and interconnected challenges which threaten their economic development. Addressing these issues is not only critical for the well-being of roughly 6.6 billion people, translating to 84% of the world’s population, but also for fostering global stability and growth opportunities. One of the most pressing challenges for the for most lower- to middle-income countries is climate change. Many of these nations are disproportionately affected by rising temperatures, adverse weather, and natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes. In tandem with climate change, the loss of biodiversity, deforestation, and unsustainable land use amplify environmental and economic vulnerabilities. From a financial perspective, innovative solutions hold immense potential to mitigate these challenges. Green finance, including green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and other products, offers pathways for funding climate adaptation and mitigation projects. Furthermore, financial instruments tailored to LMI countries, such as microfinance, social impact bonds, and blended finance, empower local communities, enhance resilience, and drive inclusive development. Other significant challenges stem from geopolitics and economic dependency. Many of the low- and middle-income countries contend with a legacy of colonialism or face modern-day exploitation. The asymmetrical power dynamics in global trade, investment, and governance often exacerbate the economic fragility of these regions. Emerging geopolitical tensions further challenge these nations, as they navigate the complex dynamics of foreign aid, trade partnerships, and political alliances. Financial markets might support capital access, restructuring sovereign debt, and promoting sustainable foreign direct investment. However, weak governance, corruption, and political instability in many of these countries undermine efforts to create inclusive and sustainable growth. Financial governance reforms, digital payment systems, and transparency-driven blockchain technologies represent financial tools that can help address these systemic issues. This special issue aims to attract innovative and interdisciplinary research that examines these and related challenges from a Finance-focused perspective. We invite submissions that offer novel perspectives, robust analyses, and solutions leveraging financial markets and tools to address the multifaceted issues that low- and middle-income countries are facing. We aim to foster a deeper understanding of the barriers to development to offer policies and strategies that promote global equity. Timeline Open for submissions: April 1, 2025 Last date to submit: July 31, 2025 Handling editor Prof. Dr. Tony Klein, Professor of Finance, Faculty of Business and Economics, TU Chemnitz, Germany; tony.klein@wiwi.tu-chemnitz.de Submission Fee Waivers Submission fees are waived for submissions to this special issue. Important Submission Information -\tAuthors should prepare their manuscript in line with author guidelines of Finance Research Letters, available online. All submissions that do not adhere to the word limit or the scope of the special issue will be desk rejected. Furthermore, all submissions must be within the scope of the journal. -\tPapers for the special issue should be submitted through the Finance Research Letters submission system. -\tWhen submitting, please ensure that you select the special issue called “VSI: LMIC Challenges.” -\tSubmissions to this SI are subject to a regular peer-review process.

All sessions will be plenary. Keynote Speaker The keynote address will be given by Michaela Pagel from Washington University's Olin Business School, where she is an Associate Professor. She is an NBER Faculty Research Fellow and a CEPR Research Affiliate. She received her Ph.D. from the Economics Department at UC Berkeley and works on topics in behavioral economics, household finance, and macroeconomics.

      "description": "09 Oct 2025 - 10 Oct 2025 Executive compensation practices at large companies attract attention from a range of perspectives. They shape the incentives of executives and can affect firm behavior, they are affected by the regulatory environment in which publicly-traded firms operate, they have been the subject of disclosure and corporate governance reforms, and they affect the income distribution. To better understand the determinants of compensation practices for top executives, and the consequences of different practices, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), with the generous support of Norges Bank Investment Management, will convene a research conference on Thursday-Friday, October 9–10, 2025 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The meeting will be organized by Dirk Jenter (London School of Economics) and Kelly Shue (Yale University and NBER). Research on top executive compensation from various sub-fields of economics, including financial economics, industrial organization, labor economics, law and economics, and public finance, is welcome. Papers using new data sources or innovative research methods are especially welcome. Particular topics of interest include, but are not limited to: •\tThe effects of CEO pay on firm performance and behavior •\tThe relationship between CEO pay and the market for executive talent •\tThe role of institutional investors and other shareholders in setting CEO pay •\tDrivers of variation in CEO pay across time, firms, and countries •\tThe optimal design of CEO pay contracts •\tThe effects of regulation on CEO pay The organizers welcome submissions of both empirical and theoretical research, including papers by scholars who are early in their careers and who are not NBER affiliates. To be considered for inclusion on the program, papers must be uploaded by 11:59pm ET on Monday, June 23, 2025 via the following link: https://conference.nber.org/confsubmit/backend/cfp?id=ECBf25 Please do not submit papers that have been accepted for publication and that will be published by October 2025.

The target audience is advanced Ph.D. students and professors in finance and related fields. We will take a practical, hands-on approach that focuses on tools. Topics will include numerical methods for solving models, simulation estimators, identification challenges, and a review of the literature. Participants will attend lectures for the first half of each day and then spend the second half applying the material to a mini-research project. The project involves solving and estimating a simple dynamic model. By the end of the week, participants will have done structural estimation, and they will leave with computer code they can use in their future research.

      "location": "Bank of Finland, Helsinki",
      "description": "27 Jun 2025 - 28 Jun 2025 AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a new transformative technology that has shown its potential during the recent years. As evidenced, the fast development of AI methods and data centricity in finance is providing opportunities, but it is also posing new challenges to our economies. In particular, we have seen an uplift in several areas of AI, but especially in language technology and LLMs (Large Language Models). These technologies could change our societies profoundly, and therefore well-planned and targeted policies are key to develop a safe and sustainable society with the AI. Similarly to last year, this year’s Systemic Risk Analytics conference has a strong focus on AI and systemic risk. The aim of the conference is to adopt methods and techniques from other disciplines, such as computer science, engineering, biology and physics, that use computer-intensive approaches, novel data sources, and of course AI. Examples of possible topics include how LLMs can be used to detect systemic risk, how the use of AI can change interdependencies in the financial markets and whether AI and quantum computing can pose new sources of systemic risks, e.g. operational risks and cyber risks. Beyond of this, the conference welcomes also submissions on more traditional tools of systemic risk analytics and macroprudential policy, such as early-warning indicators, network and contagion analysis, macro stress-testing and tools for big data analytics. The conference includes several keynotes, presentations and poster sessions. Extended abstracts are welcome as well. Topics for panel discussions are especially welcome this year. Topics The themes of the conference cover policy and practitioner-oriented research related to systemic risk measurement. We solicit contributions covering a broad range of techniques related to systemic risk analytics, particularly related to (but not limited to) the following themes: - Use of Large Language Models (LLM) and trustworthy AI - AI and changing interdependencies in the financial markets - Cyber security and operational risks as sources of systemic risk - AI and Quantum Computing as potential source of new systemic risks - Use of AI with big data for systemic risk analytics - Risks and opportunities stemming from disruptive innovations in financial technology (FinTech) - Using systemic risk analytics to support macro-prudential policy and regulation - Analysing emerging risks from interconnectedness of the financial system - Identifying risks from market-based finance - Evidence of macroprudential policy measures - Economic policies in the turbulent and uncertain times Paper Submission Papers to be considered for presentation at the conference and workshop should be submitted via online form by 17 March 2025: https://www.lyyti.in/SRA2025. Accepted paper presenters will be notified in due course, as well as the format of the presentations; there will be both oral and poster presentations in the conference. Format, Timing And Venue The conference will be held in a hybrid format, allowing virtual participation. The conference will take place on 27-28 June 2025 at Bank of Finland in Helsinki. The conference includes keynotes, panel discussions, presentations and poster sessions. The conference is accompanied with a social event for speakers on 27 June, taking place at the Bank of Finland Villa as well as the anniversary dinner at 28th.

      "description": "The Fixed Income Analysts Society (FIASI), in collaboration with Fordham University's Center for Research in Contemporary Finance and the O'Shea Center for Credit Analysis and Investment, is announcing the launch of the 5th Annual FIASI-Gabelli School Student Research Competition. This co-branded competition invites undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students to submit their ongoing original research on the topic of investing and innovations in sustainable finance in fixed income or related markets1. The primary purpose of the competition is to raise awareness and highlight the importance of integrating relevant and material Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)-based factors into investment decisions in the fixed income markets as a research area, address challenges and opportunities associated with the deployment of new technologies and solutions to solve vital sustainability-related business challenges and to gain more visibility for and encourage conversations among students, academics, practitioners as well as other stakeholders. Although the primary focus of this competition is to encourage student research on sustainable finance in the fixed income markets, research papers in related markets that are still relevant for fixed income will also be accepted. In addition to recognizing a winning submission, the competition may also recognize one or more runner-up entries. In both cases, distinctions will be made between undergraduate and post-graduate submissions. Winning and runner-up research papers will be eligible to receive monetary award grants of up to $5,000 and recognition at the full-day FIASI Sustainable Finance in Fixed Income conference scheduled to be held on April 9, 2025, in NYC. Payments will be made directly to the recipients. These grants do not in any way preclude subsequent publication of the research in journals of the recipients' choice. The recipients should agree to acknowledge this grant in all publications and presentations and to present the research at a mutually convenient date following the FIASI conference. For reference, our 4th Annual Research Competition fielded twenty-four research paper submissions. In addition to the competition winner, there were also two runner-ups last May, each receiving a monetary award. The first prize winner presented his research paper at a virtual event hosted jointly by FIASI and Fordham, which was attended by students, academics, and industry practitioners. For additional information, see https://www.fiasi.org. In addition to schools with business programs and other sustainable finance-oriented programs throughout the US, the scope of the competition, which was expanded, now includes submissions by students pursuing PhD. programs in schools located outside the US. US and non-US doctoral students are welcome to submit their research for the competition. Examples of student submissions include PhD. dissertations, Masters theses, Undergraduate Honors program theses, or any similar research. Research papers co-authored between students and faculty are also welcome. Submissions from undergraduate and post-graduate students will be evaluated in separate pools, and awards will be chosen independently from these pools. All submissions should consist of the following: A cover page with title, names of authors, e-mail addresses, and affiliation, including any past or present corporate affiliations; An abstract of up to 150 words; A research paper, and A copy of (each) researcher's resume. A review committee will select the winners from the submitted research papers. In making its selections, the committee will seek input from colleagues at FIASI, the Gabelli School of Business finance area, as well as other fixed income practitioners. The review committee will consist of members drawn from the academic community, the Fixed Income Analysts Society, and the fixed income industry. Research papers will be judged based on the originality and relevance of the research question as well as the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the research methodology. Applicants should submit their proposals to Ms. Joanna Kondratowicz at jkondratowicz@fordham.edu by January 20, 2025. Decisions will be made prior to April 9, 2025. The competition is co-funded by the Fixed Income Analysts Society and Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business. Additional questions or inquiries should be directed to Lauren Nauser, Executive Director, FIASI at nauser@fiasi.org. *Submissions from both full-time and part-time students will be accepted. The research should reflect the student's own analysis and should contain a disclaimer that the research is not in any way connected to or derives from a previous or current employer.",

      "description": "July 28-31, 2025 The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA The goal of this four-day program is to teach young scholars the tools they need to understand and conduct corporate finance research using structural estimation. The target audience is advanced Ph.D. students and professors in finance and related fields. We will take a practical, hands-on approach that focuses on tools. Topics will include numerical methods for solving models, simulation estimators, identification challenges, and a review of the literature. Participants will attend lectures for the first half of each day and then spend the second half applying the material to a mini-research project. The project involves solving and estimating a simple dynamic model. By the end of the week, participants will have done structural estimation, and they will leave with computer code they can use in their future research.

      "description": "ANR-funded \"Equipement d'excellence since 2021, Pladifes aims to make innovative data available to academic research in the service of sustainable finance research. The program, hosted by the Institut Louis Bachelier, proposes to provide free access to its COGEM database, as well as personalized support in data use, for up to 5 selected research projects. COGEM is currently the largest available database of emissions from listed companies, estimated by Machine Learning using an open-source methodology. Data is available from 2005 to 2024, on scopes 1, 2 and 3. This database is already and will remain available to non-selected academics, at a cost of €1,200 + management fees per user. This call is open to the entire academic community, with no restrictions in terms of academic disciplines or methodological approaches. Selected projects may address the following use cases, although this is not an exhaustive list (see below). • Study of the effect of national policies on emissions and carbon intensities at company level. • Study of transition risk and/or reputational risk. • Study of trends and reductions in carbon emissions. • Calculation of financed emissions and carbon footprint of insurers. • Conduct stress tests. • Assessment of companies' alignment with climate scenarios. • Study of the links between companies' financial and environmental performance. • Assessing the credibility of emissions targets published by companies. Projects must involve at least one researcher affiliated to an academic institution. Projects involving several teams, and in particular those with a real European dimension, will be studied with particular interest. Priority will be given to innovative projects exploring themes or mobilizing approaches that have been little explored. Similarly, for projects of equal quality and interest, the jury will give priority to applications in which the support provided by Pladifes data is decisive and differentiating for the project's success. Applicants are therefore invited to highlight in their application the added value they expect from COGEM data for their research. • Selected projects will be subject to the following requirements: Any publication involving the use of data obtained via this call for projects must obligatorily quote the following (in French or English version below): “Research work carried out thanks to the Pladifes COGEM project as part of the EquipEx Pladifes (ANR-21-ESRE-0036), hosted at the Institut Louis Bachelier”. • At the end of a maximum period of one year after being selected, prize-winners will be expected to submit a scientific working paper summarizing the work in which the data were used, including any unfinished work. The Institut Louis Bachelier also undertakes not to divulge or use this information, except with the explicit agreement of the prize-winners. • Winners will be invited to present their work at a dedicated event, around September 2026. Barring exceptional constraints, participation, either on-site or remotely, will be compulsory. Further details of the event will be communicated closer to the time HOW TO APPLY: Submissions can be made no later than May 16, 2025 via our submission form. Submissions should be between 2 and 5 pages long (excluding bibliography) and structured as follows: • Interest of the subject and context • Project description and methodology • Expected contribution • Presentation of the research team • Timetable Submission form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeN7mcfxutYorOkbnWbleDNqUl4U2fQQff3QR75GMjUBMj_dg/viewform?usp=header MORE INFORMATION: Pladifes website: https://pladifes.institutlouisbachelier.org/ COGEM webpage: https://pladifes.institutlouisbachelier.org/ghg-emissions/ Contact : Thibaud BARREAU, thibaud.barreau@institutlouisbachelier.org",

      "description": "A new issue of Finance Theory Insights, \"Surprising implications of regulations and technological advancement,\" is now available at https://www.financetheory.org/insights/issue-7-june-2025. It is published by the Finance Theory Group, the premier finance theory association. Finance Theory Insights highlights novel insights from a select set of recently published finance theory papers. Each column summarizes key results from a research paper, in non-technical terms, highlighting the novelty of the analysis and its implications to questions that regulators and practitioners care about. OVERVIEW: The current issue highlights surprising implications of regulations and technological advancement, which are at odds with what some would argue is common wisdom. “From Market Making to Matchmaking: Does Bank Regulation Harm Market Liquidity?” demonstrates that raising capital requirements for banks can, in the presence of competition from non bank liquidity providers, lead to lower average trading costs for customers. “Disclosing to Informed Traders” illustrates the downside of policymakers adopting one-size-fits-all disclosure rules. “Technological Progress and Rent Seeking” shows that while technological improvements make inputs more productive, they also make it easier for firms to appropriate the higher production of others. Finally, modern financial institutions have access to an array of sophisticated risk management tools that allow them to bundle risks in creative ways to enhance diversification, suggesting banks should have become more resilient over time. “Booms, busts, and common risk exposures” challenges this perceived wisdom by showing that superior risk management technologies can increase the overlap between banks’ portfolios and thereby make the system more rather than less fragile.",
