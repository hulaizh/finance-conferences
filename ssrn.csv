The conference will be held in person in Cleveland, Ohio, and virtually. The global financial system continues to contend with major economic shifts and technological advancements worldwide. Risks and opportunities abound as the system navigates unprecedented internal vulnerabilities and external shocks. Conference Format The conference will bring together policymakers, market participants, and researchers in two types of sessions: •	Policy Discussions These sessions feature keynote addresses and panel discussions in which participants from industry, regulatory agencies, and academia share their insights. •	Research Forums These forums follow the format of an academic workshop and comprise sessions where researchers present and discuss submitted papers. Topics We welcome submissions of research on topics related to potential financial stability risks faced by financial markets and institutions, sources of financial system resilience, and related public policy. Conference topics include, but are not limited to, the following: Financial Institutions A rapidly changing economic environment poses challenges for financial institutions and their supervisors. Risk management tools and strategies will be tested by fluctuations in inflation, output, and changing regulatory conditions. A rapidly evolving fintech and digital asset sector, along with the associated network effects, can lead to further risks at a systemic level. How will institutions adapt as these risks and regulations change at an unprecedented pace? How can regulators and policymakers prepare? Are existing microprudential and macroprudential toolkits sufficient? We welcome submissions on the following topics and others relating to financial institutions and financial stability: •	Bank lending to nonbank financial institutions (NBFI) •	Insurance markets •	Banking as a service (BaaS) •	Interest rate risk •	Risks of rapid growth •	The changing regulatory environment •	Banking in an uncertain monetary policy landscape •	Geopolitical risk Financial Markets Inflation, high levels of debt, geopolitical shifts, and central bank policy around the world have added stress to financial markets not seen in the recent past. Volatility spikes, fire sales, and financial contagion happen at an increasing pace. The continued development of algorithms, decentralized finance (DeFi), and complex artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to add novel risks and blur the distinctions between markets and institutions. Do investors recognize these risks? How quickly can investors adapt to the changing circumstances? How does the opacity resulting from deficiencies in reporting, risk management, and operational standards for these risks affect investor behavior? We welcome submissions on the following topics and others relating to financial markets and financial stability: •	Risks associated with high levels of public debt and with central bank balance sheet policies •	Short-term funding •	Central clearing of government bonds •	Regulation of digital assets •	The future of the U.S. dollar in financial markets •	Financial markets in a fragmented world •	Real estate outlook •	The future of monetary policy Technology and the Financial System New technologies are developing at an accelerating pace and are influencing the way that financial institutions and markets are managed and supervised. What will be the impact of artificial intelligence on the financial system? What are the risks and opportunities from a new environment for digital assets? How can firms adapt to the growing threat of cyber risk? How can policymakers understand and benefit from these new technologies? We welcome submissions on the following topics and others relating to technology and financial stability: •	The impact of generative AI and deep learning models •	The rise of fintech •	Digital assets •	Cyber attacks •	Faster settlement for payments and securities •	Supervision and policymaking in the new technological age Scientific Program Reviewers •	Will Cong, Cornell SC Johnson College of Business •	Victoria Ivashina, Harvard Business School •	Chotibhak Jotikasthira, Southern Methodist University, Cox School of Business •	Anton Korinek, University of Virginia, Darden School of Business •	Nagpurnanand Prabhala, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School •	Gregory Nini, Drexel University, LeBow College of Business •	Gregory F.

"STARTUP CITIES: STRATEGIES, STAKEHOLDERS AND IMPACT",21 Nov 2025,"Milan, Italy","Entrepreneurial activity—particularly that supported by alternative investors—tends to concentrate in large urban centers due to factors such as founder co-location, access to skilled labor, and the proximity of venture capital. Yet today’s urban entrepreneurial ecosystems face a new generation of challenges, as they grapple with balancing the often-competing interests of startups, investors, and local communities under conditions of growing uncertainty.

The event will be held at Bocconi University on November 21, 2025. We are seeking high-quality submissions employing diverse theoretical perspectives and methods to deal with these topics: 1. Micro-geography of entrepreneurship 2. Relationship between urban contexts and entrepreneurship 3. Entrepreneurial finance and local impacts 4. Social inequality and entrepreneurship 5. Local public policies and entrepreneurship 6. Sustainability of startup ecosystems The workshop will include keynote addresses by Scott Stern (MIT) and Mario Small (Columbia University), as well as an industry panel featuring policymakers, investors, and institutional stakeholders.

Both empirical and theoretical papers are welcome, including preliminary drafts. The format is a short presentation, followed by comments from discussants and open conversation among participants and the audience. The conference will be in-person in Cambridge, MA and online.

2025 Wharton Conference on Liquidity and Financial Fragility,10 Oct 2025 - 11 Oct 2025,"Philadelphia, PA","2025 Wharton Conference on Liquidity and Financial Fragility Call for Papers Liquidity and financial fragility have been central to academic research and policy debates. In recent decades, episodes of acute market stress, such as the global financial crises, the pandemic, and regional banking turmoil, have highlighted the complex interplay between liquidity provision, financial stability, and broader macroeconomic outcomes. Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of new technologies is reshaping markets and introducing new risks. Although government policies and interventions may help contain systemic risks, they also bring uncertainty and intensify tensions between price and financial stability. As global financial conditions in 2025 continue to reflect elevated uncertainty and geopolitical strain, the need to understand the drivers and consequences of financial fragility and its global macroeconomic implications remains as vital as ever. With this goal in mind, we are pleased to announce the 2025 Wharton Conference on Liquidity and Financial Fragility, building on the success of the past ten editions. The eleventh edition will be held at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), beginning on the morning of Friday, October 10, 2025, and concluding in the afternoon of Saturday, October 11, 2025. A conference dinner will take place on Friday evening, featuring a keynote address by Antoinette Schoar, Executive Editor of the Journal of Finance and the Stewart C. Myers-Horn Family Professor of Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Further details on past editions of the conference are available on the conference website: https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wharton-liquidity-conference/ We invite submissions of empirical and theoretical papers in various fields of economics and finance that relate to the broad theme of Liquidity and Financial Fragility. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: •	Coordination failures, self-fulfilling beliefs, and runs •	Fragility in banks and non-bank institutions •	Liquidity and frictions in financial markets and macroeconomy •	Systemic risk and financial regulation •	Monetary policy and financial stability •	Dysfunctions, frictions, and fragility in U.S. Treasury markets •	Currency dominance, sovereign debt crises, and their link to the financial sector •	Geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts, and financial fragility •	Inflation, interest rate risks, and implications on financial fragility •	The real impact of crises and fragility on firms’ financing and investment policies •	FinTech, artificial intelligence (AI), and their implications for financial stability •	New payment technologies, digital currencies, and their implications for the monetary system The organizers of the conference are Vincent Glode, Itay Goldstein, and Yao Zeng (all from Wharton Finance), and Guillermo Ordonez (from Penn Economics).

Developments in Sustainable Finance: A New Era of Financial Innovation,30 Oct 2025 - 02 Nov 2025,"American University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","Conference Sponsored by Birmingham Institute for Sustainability and Climate Action (BISCA) Sustainable Financial Innovation Centre (SFiC) American University of Sharjah (AUS) UAE-UK Business Council Sustainable finance has made remarkable strides over the past decade, with fund managers and corporations increasingly under pressure from stakeholders and shareholder activism to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into their portfolios and asset allocation strategies. This shift has been driven by growing awareness of climate risks and the demand for responsible investing. Developments in green and sustainability-linked bonds, and ESG-focused investment portfolios highlight the growing importance of aligning financial practices with sustainable goals. These innovative financial instruments help bridge the gap between environmental and financial sectors, contributing to the global effort to address climate change and other pressing environmental challenges. Moreover, regulatory frameworks and policy initiatives such as the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) have been instrumental in pushing forward the sustainable finance agenda (European Commission, 2024). However, recent geopolitical tensions have begun to slow this momentum. A particularly significant setback occurred with President Trump’s second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which undermined global climate commitments and introduced uncertainty about the future direction of climate policy. This withdrawal, along with other geopolitical factors, has led some companies to hesitate in fully pursuing their ESG agendas, fearing that the lack of cohesive international policy could create financial and operational risks. Despite these challenges, there are rising calls to harness rapid technological advancements—particularly in artificial intelligence (AI)—to drive more innovative solutions to the climate crisis. AI offers tremendous potential for improving the accuracy of climate risk assessments, optimizing energy consumption, and developing sustainable infrastructure, which could help mitigate the impact of climate change. By leveraging these technological innovations, the financial sector could help accelerate progress toward sustainability, even in the face of uncertain political climates. Looking ahead, sustainable finance is expected to continue evolving as both market demand and regulatory pressures increase as global environmental challenges become more urgent, however, the dynamics of sustainable finance in directing capital flows towards environmentally and socially responsible projects will be different to cope with the recent development on geopolitical uncertainty. Therefore, this conference will highlight the latest developments in sustainable finance during these volatile times, focusing on how innovation, particularly through emerging technologies, can help address climate challenges and drive the global economy towards a more sustainable future fostering a resilient and sustainable global economy for future generations (Eccles et al., 2021). This three-day conference will feature an evening reception, Gala dinner and Conference paper presentations. Paper submission procedure: We invite you to submit your paper to the Sustainable Financial Innovation Centre (SFiC) conference by sending it directly to our email: h.farag@bham.ac.uk Please use the subject heading Paper Submission: Developments in Sustainable Finance: A New Era of Financial Innovation.” In your submissions, please indicate whether you want your paper to be considered for The International Journal of Finance & Economics.

2025 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference: Call for Papers,16 Oct 2025 - 17 Oct 2025,"Boston, Massachusetts","The conference will be held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on October 16 and 17, 2025 Paper Submission Deadline: Sunday, June 15, 2025 The Federal Reserve invites researchers to submit academic research papers to be considered for presentation at a conference on the topic of stress testing. The conference will provide a forum for researchers in academic and policy institutions to discuss important topics, methods, and challenges related to stress testing for financial institutions and the financial system. Background Since the Great Financial Crisis, stress testing has become a key tool for evaluating the resilience of financial institutions and the financial system. For example, supervisory stress tests of large US banks are now conducted annually by the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar stress testing efforts have also been adopted internationally in recent years. Stress testing has become increasingly important in assessing the resilience of the financial system. It has also become a more prominent risk management tool for financial institutions. Accordingly, stress testing as a discipline has become an increasingly important area for economic research and policy. This conference is part of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to highlight research into stress testing. For more information, please visit the website below, which also has links to prior conference agendas including 2024: https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/events/federal-reserve-stress-testing-research-conference/2025.aspx.

Some of the paper presentations will be followed by discussions. With the authors’ approval, the papers presented at the conference may be made available to the public on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Paper Submission Topics The conference will consider high quality research papers broadly related to stress testing. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: • The economic and macroprudential effects of stress tests and bank regulation • Balancing the costs and benefits of bank regulation • The roles and risks of nonbank financial intermediaries and their interplay with the banking system • Financial instruments for risk transfer and their implications • Modeling bank revenues, credit, and counterparty risks • Interest-rate, liquidity, and inflation risk in the banking system • Design of macroeconomic and financial market scenarios • Regulatory and supervisory approaches to non-financial risks, such as cybersecurity and operational risk, and emerging technologies, such as AI Paper Submissions We invite authors to submit papers or extended abstracts to StressTestingConference@frb.gov by Sunday, June 15, 2025.

"Future Finance Fest (3f), Vilnius, Lithuania, 25-27 August 2025",25 Aug 2025 - 27 Aug 2025,"Vilnius, Lithuania","FINAL CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS AND UPDATE Future Finance Fest (3f) 3f seeks to foster deep conversations and collaborations between finance academics and fintechs. Any work with practical implications for the future of finance is welcome. Submissions are accepted through two tracks: the academic track and the fintech/practitioner track. Individual conference sessions, however, will deliberately include presentations from both academics and fintechs. This means that presentations will need to minimize jargon in order to be accessible and engaging to both sides. In addition to presentation sessions, there will be keynotes and panel discussions. The closing keynote will be delivered by Professor Albert J. Menkveld (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute). Confirmed panelists include Dr. Christel Rendu de Lint, co-CEO of Vontobel Asset Management, and Mr. Lukas Savickas, Minister of the Economy and Innovation of the Republic of Lithuania. 3f will take place in Old Town Vilnius (a UNESCO World Heritage site), in collaboration with key players in the Lithuanian fintech ecosystem. For more information about 3f, visit https://fufifest.org. 3f is aiming to make an impact not only on the future of finance, but also on the future of finance conferences. To this end, we will be experimenting with multiple innovations. All presenters will have the option of being professionally filmed and receiving recordings of their presentations, at no cost. The audience will have the opportunity to type in live commentary/questions during a presentation that will be shown on a separate screen (but only if the presenter agrees to this). All authors of submissions accepted through the academic track can request AI-generated podcasts about their papers, at no cost. 3f is sponsored by Ed.movie Inc., which produced the Finance+Humor program at the 50th European Finance Association meeting, and panel discussions will partially inherit its light-hearted spirit (see e.g. the “Finance Meets Comedy” talk show recorded at the EFA, https://youtu.be/RbqAmBgs55w). SUBMISSION AND REGISTRATION: The submission deadline is Monday, 14 April. Those submitting through the academic track can submit full papers (including early-stage work), extended abstracts or case studies. Those submitting through the practitioner/fintech track can submit papers, extended abstracts, case studies, slide decks and proposals for panel discussions. All those submitting to 3f should add a note explaining why their work is relevant to both academics and practitioners/fintechs. Decisions will be communicated by Monday, 26 May. There is no submission fee. To register and/or to submit your work, visit https://www.conftool.net/fufifest2025/. The registration fee includes access to all of the event activities, meals and snacks.

5th CEPR-Stigler Center Conference on Political Economy of Finance: Governance in a Polarized World,24 Oct 2025,London,"In a time of large shocks and rising inequality, the political divide is growing. Polarization forces changes to private and public governance, reshaping financial markets, corporate strategies and public policy. How does corporate governance adjust in a more conflictual world? How do a divided society and politicized corporations respond to major societal challenges such as climate change or economic decline? How do inequality and politicization shape governance choices and the trade-offs faced by voters, businesses and governments? How can organizations foster trust and cohesion in an era of polarization? The conference invites theoretical and empirical papers on these and related themes. The conference will be held in-person at Imperial College London. The conference is scheduled on Friday 24 October 2025 and followed by a dinner with all participants. The keynote will be delivered by Nobel Laureate: prof. Jean Tirole (Toulouse School of Economics).

Call for Papers and PhD Thesis Nomination - Inaugural Finance Conference Vitznau 2025,28 Jun 2025 - 29 Jun 2025,"Vitznau, Switzerland","In addition to contributed papers, the program will feature presentations by Keynote speakers Andrei Shleifer (Harvard University) and Bryan Kelly (Yale University), panels including Lubos Pastor (University of Chicago), Boris Vujčić (Croatian National Bank), and Christian Keller (Barclays Capital), and a policy keynote by Veronika Grimm (Technical University of Nuremberg). Asset pricing is inherently a field that produces research relevant to the practice of asset management and financial markets but is also informed by real-world market dynamics. Surprisingly, much of academic research overlooks implementability and feasibility, often abstracting from real-world constraints such as transaction costs. Moreover, most research in asset pricing still adheres to the paradigm of rational expectations and efficient markets at a time when the plethora of return predictors produces an embarrassment of riches. The conference aims to embrace the idea of inefficiently efficient markets, to stress the role of non-rational expectations, and to focus on implementable portfolios. Moreover, the conference will focus on feasible machine-learning portfolios, big data analysis, and alternative data for return prediction. More broadly speaking, topics of interest include, but are not limited to: - Machine learning for the cross-section of returns - Big data analysis - Large language models and unstructured data - Non-standard datasets for return predictions - Systematic expectations mistakes, and predictable returns - Feasible and implementable portfolios - Predictable turning points We invite authors to submit completed papers or extended abstracts. Completed papers are preferred. If you know of a paper that fits the conference theme, please forward this call to the authors. Please note that the event is in-person only. The conference will be the start of the newly founded Department of Wealth Creation at the Luke Lucerne Institute. Please submit your contribution to frr@llui.org with ‘Call for Papers‘ in the subject line. The organizers will select papers based on originality, analytical rigor, and practical relevance. The deadline for paper submission is 18h00 (GMT) April 15, 2025. Only the authors of accepted papers will be informed by April 30, 2025. Travel and local accommodation for speakers from academic institutions will be funded by the organizers. Organizing Committee: Francesco D’Acunto (Georgetown University) Andreas Neuhierl (Washington University St. Louis) Alberto Rossi (Georgetown University) Michael Weber (University of Chicago) PhD Thesis Finance Research Revolution Prize In addition to the conference, the organizers invite faculty to nominate PhD students who were on the academic job market in the 2024/2025 job market season whose dissertation falls within the broad theme of the conference. The nomination should consist of a letter of recommendation and the job market paper and be sent to the organizing committee (frr@llui.org) with ‘PhD Thesis Finance Research Revolution Prize’ as subject. The winner is invited to participate at the conference and will receive the Finance Research Revolution Prize, which includes a CHF 10,000 cash award, presented during a festive ceremony at Saturday’s dinner.

Compensation of Top Executives: Determinants and Consequences,09 Oct 2025 - 10 Oct 2025,"Cambridge, MA","Executive compensation practices at large companies attract attention from a range of perspectives.

"Call for Papers: 10th RiskLab Finland, Bank of Finland and European Systemic Risk Board Joint Conference on AI and Systemic Risk Analytics",27 Jun 2025 - 28 Jun 2025,"Bank of Finland, Helsinki","AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a new transformative technology that has shown its potential during the recent years. As evidenced, the fast development of AI methods and data centricity in finance is providing opportunities, but it is also posing new challenges to our economies. In particular, we have seen an uplift in several areas of AI, but especially in language technology and LLMs (Large Language Models). These technologies could change our societies profoundly, and therefore well-planned and targeted policies are key to develop a safe and sustainable society with the AI. Similarly to last year, this year’s Systemic Risk Analytics conference has a strong focus on AI and systemic risk. The aim of the conference is to adopt methods and techniques from other disciplines, such as computer science, engineering, biology and physics, that use computer-intensive approaches, novel data sources, and of course AI. Examples of possible topics include how LLMs can be used to detect systemic risk, how the use of AI can change interdependencies in the financial markets and whether AI and quantum computing can pose new sources of systemic risks, e.g. operational risks and cyber risks. Beyond of this, the conference welcomes also submissions on more traditional tools of systemic risk analytics and macroprudential policy, such as early-warning indicators, network and contagion analysis, macro stress-testing and tools for big data analytics. The conference includes several keynotes, presentations and poster sessions. Extended abstracts are welcome as well. Topics for panel discussions are especially welcome this year. Topics The themes of the conference cover policy and practitioner-oriented research related to systemic risk measurement. We solicit contributions covering a broad range of techniques related to systemic risk analytics, particularly related to (but not limited to) the following themes: - Use of Large Language Models (LLM) and trustworthy AI - AI and changing interdependencies in the financial markets - Cyber security and operational risks as sources of systemic risk - AI and Quantum Computing as potential source of new systemic risks - Use of AI with big data for systemic risk analytics - Risks and opportunities stemming from disruptive innovations in financial technology (FinTech) - Using systemic risk analytics to support macro-prudential policy and regulation - Analysing emerging risks from interconnectedness of the financial system - Identifying risks from market-based finance - Evidence of macroprudential policy measures - Economic policies in the turbulent and uncertain times Paper Submission Papers to be considered for presentation at the conference and workshop should be submitted via online form by 17 March 2025: https://www.lyyti.in/SRA2025. Accepted paper presenters will be notified in due course, as well as the format of the presentations; there will be both oral and poster presentations in the conference.

CALL FOR PAPERS for Conference on Fintech Advances in Emerging Markets,29 Jun 2025,"Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China","Fintech developments: Emerging markets have led the world in technology-enabled innovation in financial services (Fintech). Early examples of important innovations to come from emerging markets and spread globally range from mobile money services (M-Pesa in Africa), to super-apps (Alipay and WeChat in China, and MobiKwik and Paytm in India). These early movers have been followed by numerous extensions and adaptations such as crowdfunding, micro-x offerings, and central bank digital currencies. The emergence of Fintech in emerging markets calls for the sharing of experiences in both opportunities to financial market deepening and risks to financial stability for academics, practitioners, policymakers and regulators. Fintech is affecting vast areas of financial services and challenging the dominance of the banking sector. Policymakers need to assess the adequacy of their regulatory frameworks as the adoption of Fintech increases, with the objective of harnessing its benefits while mitigating risks to financial stability. It also is important to understand how the business models of existing financial institutions and the market structure are changing in response to these developments. Conference: The School of Management and Economics, Shenzhen Finance Institute, and Shenzhen Institute of Data Economy, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen) in collaboration with academics at UNSW Business School, UNSW Sydney are sponsoring the African-China Conference on Fintech. The conference will be held in Shenzhen, PRC, 29 June, 2025 right before the 2025 China International Conference on Finance. The conference aims to stimulate research ideas among academic researchers, practitioners, and policy makers from around the world who are interested in Fintech in emerging markets. In particular, we would like to provide a framework on which future analysis and monitoring can be made, for ensuring a strong, sustainable, and resilient financial system as innovations in financial services evolve. We will cover registration and two-night accommodation costs for one presenter of every accepted paper. We welcome paper submissions in any field of Fintech relevant to emerging markets, particularly those that are related to the following topics: •	Fintech innovations •	Fintech and financing for households and SMEs •	Cryptocurrencies and financial stability •	Central bank and digital currencies •	Big data, AI (including machine learning) and financial services •	Internet lending •	Regtech and financial stability •	Fintech challenges for financial regulation •	Effects of new technologies and digitalization on systemic risk •	The role of currency unions, customs unions and single markets Any other topics related to the conference theme would also be considered. PAPER SUBMISSION PROCEDURE: Authors can email their submission to Jerry Parwada (j.parwada@unsw.edu.au).

2025 Accountability in a Sustainable World Conference,24 Sep 2025 - 25 Sep 2025,Virtual,"Contributed talks are sought for the 5th annual Accountability in a Sustainable World Conference. Academics and non-academics will engage in a dialogue where non-academics are encouraged to suggest questions they think should be prioritized on academics' research agendas, and scholars are asked to present aspects of their research that are most relevant and informative to a broad audience of non-academics. Submission of non-academic-friendly summaries (2,000 to 4,000 words) of research published in leading academic journals is highly encouraged. The publication of these summaries increases the impact of the original work by exposing it to a broader readership base. Successful summaries include work from Ayako Yasuda, Christian Leuz, and work from Robert Kaplan and Karthik Ramanna. The 20 most suitable submissions will be presented at the conference and published in Accountability in a Sustainable World Quarterly (ASWQ). Other submissions may be considered for future issues of ASWQ, the first peer-reviewed sustainability journal to deliver academic content to broader business and academic audiences. The goal of the journal and the conference is to form a firm foundation for the exchange of ideas about pressing questions, which have the potential to be answered/informed by academic research. ASWQ advances the creation and dissemination of knowledge and understanding of topical, practical relevance issues by publishing rigorous, peer-reviewed research and thought pieces written by cutting-edge academics and non-academics. The main focus of the peer-review process will be on the authenticity of the results, claims, and conclusions in the paper. The Accountability in a Sustainable World conference will again coincide with the Sustainable Investment Forum, North America (SINVNA), in conjunction with the United Nations Environmental Program Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI). The conference will include 12 plenary speeches, four panel discussions, and 20 contributed talks. These sessions will be presented virtually to minimize the carbon footprint and accommodate as many delegates as possible. Please submit papers via email to asw@care-mendoza.nd.edu on or before May 31, 2025. A non-refundable submission fee of $200 must be received within 10 business days of submission.

It examines a wide range of behavioural finance topics, ranging between financial decision making and biases, herding, corporate finance, fund management, asset pricing, financial forecasting, volatility, and market sentiment.

Submissions examining these topics, as well as the ethicality of the financial markets, financial regulation and governance, will be particularly welcome. As usual, we will consider papers in all areas of common concern to those working in behavioural finance and related areas. These include processes underlying the financial judgments and decisions involved in investing, trading, forecasting, risk assessment, asset valuations, acquisitions, IPOs, asset pricing bubbles, financial crises, and other financial behaviours. As well as such associated cognitive and emotional phenomena as overconfidence, framing, loss aversion, herding, sentiment, optimism, biased information search, over/under reaction, the money illusion and other biases, we are equally interested in drawing on emotional and psychodynamic perspectives, group psychology, personality theory including narcissism and psychopathology, and narratology in the context of the role story telling plays in all financial activity.
