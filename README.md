# 🎯 Conference Processing Pipeline

A comprehensive pipeline for scraping, processing, and enriching conference information from SSRN (Social Science Research Network) using AI-powered data extraction.

## 🚀 Overview

The pipeline consists of 4 main steps:
1. **Web Scraping**: Extract conference data from SSRN professional announcements using Selenium
2. **Data Comparison**: Identify new conferences not yet in the database
3. **AI Enhancement**: Use DeepSeek API to extract additional conference details
4. **Database Update**: Merge new data with existing conference database

## 📊 Final Output

The final `conferences.csv` contains:
- **Title**: Conference title
- **Conference Dates**: Conference dates
- **Location**: Conference location
- **Link**: SSRN announcement link
- **Submission Deadline**: Paper submission deadline (extracted by AI)
- **Submission Fee**: Paper submission fee (extracted by AI)
- **Registration Fee**: Conference registration fee (extracted by AI)
- **Continent**: Conference continent (extracted by AI)

## ✨ Features

- **🚫 Bypasses 403 Forbidden Errors**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to access SSRN pages
- **📊 Complete Conference Data**: Extracts title, dates, location, and detailed descriptions
- **🤖 AI-Powered Enhancement**: Uses DeepSeek API to extract submission deadlines, fees, and continents
- **🔄 Incremental Updates**: Only processes new conferences, avoiding duplicate work
- **📁 Structured Output**: Clean CSV format with consistent columns
- **⚡ Robust Processing**: Includes rate limiting, error handling, and progress saving
- **🔍 Smart Comparison**: Compares titles to identify new conferences automatically

## 🎯 Extracted Information

For each conference, the scraper extracts:

- **title**: Conference title and call for papers information
- **conference_dates**: Conference dates (when available)
- **location**: Conference location (when available)  
- **description**: Detailed conference description from individual SSRN announcement pages
- **ssrn_link**: Direct link to the detailed SSRN announcement

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **Chrome Browser** installed
3. **ChromeDriver** installed and in PATH
   ```bash

1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Navigate to src directory
cd src

# Run basic scraping (titles and links only - faster)
python scraper.py --no-descriptions -o basic_conferences.csv

# Run complete scraping with detailed descriptions
python scraper.py -o complete_conferences.csv

# Run in visible mode for debugging
python scraper.py --visible -o conferences.csv

# Save to Excel format
python scraper.py -o conferences.xlsx
```

## 📋 Command Line Options

```bash
python scraper.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h, --help            Show help message
  -o, --output OUTPUT   Output filename (CSV or Excel)
  --no-descriptions     Skip detailed descriptions (faster)
  --headless           Run Chrome in headless mode (default)
  --visible            Run Chrome in visible mode (for debugging)
```

## 📊 Sample Output

### Basic Conference List (--no-descriptions)
```csv
title,conference_dates,location,description,ssrn_link
"2nd Annual Boca Finance and Real-Estate Conference",Not specified,Not specified,,https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/janda/announcement/?id=17482
"9th Commodity Markets Winter Workshop",Not specified,Not specified,,https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/janda/announcement/?id=17478
```

### Complete Conference Data (with descriptions)
```csv
title,conference_dates,location,description,ssrn_link
"2nd Annual Boca Finance and Real-Estate Conference",Not specified,Not specified,"The 2nd Annual Boca Finance and Real-Estate Conference will be held... [2847 characters of detailed content]",https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/janda/announcement/?id=17482
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Selenium Configuration

The scraper uses optimized Chrome options to bypass detection:

```python
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run in background
chrome_options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')
chrome_options.add_argument('--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled')
chrome_options.add_argument('--user-agent=Mozilla/5.0...')  # Real browser UA
```

### Content Extraction

The scraper intelligently extracts content from SSRN pages using:

1. **List Page Parsing**: Extracts basic conference info from the main announcements page
2. **Individual Page Fetching**: Uses Selenium to access detailed announcement pages
3. **Content Cleaning**: Removes navigation, scripts, and formatting for clean text
4. **Smart Selectors**: Targets specific content areas on SSRN pages

### Performance Optimizations

- **Respectful Delays**: 2-3 second delays between requests
- **Content Limiting**: Caps description length at 10,000 characters
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows progress every 10 conferences
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing if individual pages fail

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Based on testing with 174 conferences:

- **✅ Success Rate**: 100% for basic conference list extraction
- **✅ Detailed Content**: 100% success rate for individual page fetching
- **⚡ Speed**: ~5-7 seconds per conference (including detailed descriptions)
- **📊 Data Quality**: 1,500-6,500 characters of detailed content per conference
- **🚫 403 Errors**: 0% (completely bypassed with Selenium)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ChromeDriver Issues
```bash
# Check if ChromeDriver is installed
chromedriver --version

# Install ChromeDriver on macOS
brew install chromedriver

# Or download manually from:
# https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# On macOS, you may need to allow ChromeDriver
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
```

### Memory Issues
```bash
# For large datasets, use --no-descriptions for faster processing
python scraper.py --no-descriptions -o basic_list.csv
```
